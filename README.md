## Background and Motivation

The primary motivation for this data analyzation is based around seeing what can be improved within the Peace Corps. The Peace Corps does amazing work worldwide, if we are able to take data, use it to identify problems, and properly seek out solutions to those problems, we can create even more effective change worldwide, helping benefit the lives of millions of people. The outreach of data knows no bounds. Being able to take data and create positive change in the world should be a driving force for all research.

## Code

This repository contains one Malloy code file"
-[`Peace_Corps.malloynb`](Peace_Corps.malloynb) is a comprehensive file that both sources all the data used, and performs analysis pieces on the data

## Why Malloy?

[Malloy](https://malloydata.dev) is a unique language for primarily data querying and data visualization, providing an alternative to SQL, pandas, ggplot, and more!

## How see the analysis yourself

You can access the data by either downloading the zip file attached to this GitHub repo, or by pressing the period and running Malloy in the VSCode web browser
